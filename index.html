        This book is a collection of strangers’ lines on a blank sheet of paper. “Draw a line from one side of the page to the other”, this is the instruction 100 bypassers were given along with the reminder to freely express themselves on the surface. Where one line ends, another begins – they are all connected – they are individual expressions and a single participatory work. To complete the book, the owner of each copy is asked to draw their own line on the cover, thus becoming part of the project. Following Kandinsky’s theoretical analysis of the proto-elements of art, the line possesses its own internal sonority.
